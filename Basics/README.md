# Learning from Basics (Module 1-4) 

Here I will be sharing my learnings from module 1-4

## Module 1: Introduction to Databases

- I read about the history of the DBMS and how fundamentally it grew in the years.
- Studied about Relational vs. Non-relational database and the diffrence between both and advantages and disadvantages of both
- Read about DBMS and its types (RDBMS, NoSQL, OODBMS) and its features
- Difference between SQL and NoSQL database and how they both serve different problems.

## Module 2: Relational Database Fundamentals

- I studied about the database design, how it is taken care of, advantages of good database design and read about terms like schema, trupples, data consistency, redunduncy etc.
- Make a small ER diagram to understand its basics like components (entity, attribute and relations) and its type. Understood the uses of the shapes and thier role for creating a base for database design.
- Started working with MySQL. Locally installed it on Mac using homebrew.
- Read about the normalisation techniques and thier ways to normalise tables, how to break tables on which basis etc.
- Sometimes denormalisation is also needed to reduce the load on SQL server and read how and when to use that

## Module 3: Basic SQL Commands

- MySQL setup was done so started implementing SQL commands to understand the working of all.
- Started with Data Definition Language (DDL). Created a database and created and dropped test tables to understand the working.
- Moving forward to Data Manipulation Language (DML) starting with insert command to insert data into test tables and select to see if data is updated in the tables or not. Updated and deleted few records too.
- Read about Data Control Language (DCL) and why it is used and necessary
- What is transactions and why it is needed with that read about Transaction Control Language (TCL) 

## Module 4: Advanced SQL Queries

- Created Venn diagrams in the notebook to understand the concept of joins and then create few tables and join to see the results for different joins like inner join, left outer, right outer joins.
- Read about subqueries and made a few and understood that subqueries are not the optimal approaches and Common Table Expressions should be used to optimise big and repeating subqueries.
- Use pen and notebook to get the knowledge about set function like union and intersect and read what is window functions and different window functions and used these knowledge to solve the task 1 question.
